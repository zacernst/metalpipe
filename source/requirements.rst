============
Requirements
============

MetalPipe is written in Python 3.5. All requirements are pip-installable and
are listed n the ``requirements.txt`` file:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The documentation is written using Sphinx, so if you want to rebuild the docs,
you'll do:

```
make [html | latexpdf | whatever]
```

That ought to be everything.
